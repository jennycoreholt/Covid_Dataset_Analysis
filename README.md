# COVID-19 Data Analysis (MySQL) 
## Project Overview
This project explores global COVID-19 data (2019–2021) using MySQL to perform data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.
The goal is to extract meaningful insights, such as infection case counts, death rates, vaccination count and continent-level trends, which will be later visualised in Tableau, as part of a separate data visualisation project.

### Project Objective

To analyse COVID-19 data from multiple countries and continents to answer key analytical questions, including:

How did COVID-19 cases and deaths evolve between 2019–2021?

Which countries and continents were most impacted?

What percentage of each population was affected over time?

What percecntage of the population was vaccinated and how this impacted the infection rate?


### Dataset

Source: [Our World Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths)

Period Covered: 2019 – 2021

### Tools & Technologies

MySQL Workbench — for data cleaning, joins, calculations, and trend analysis

SQL (MySQL) — for querying, aggregations, and temporary table creation

Our World Data — as the open-source dataset provider

### Key SQL Skills Demonstrated

Data Cleaning

Date Formatting and Conversion

Aggregation and Grouping

Table Joins

Creating Temporary Tables for staged analysis

Calculating rolling sums and population-based metrics

### Insights Generated

Comparison of total COVID-19 cases and deaths across continents

Identification of countries with the highest case-fatality ratios

Trends in daily and cumulative cases

Insights into vaccination progress over time


### Next Steps

The cleaned and aggregated data from MySQL is exported into Tableau for further visualisation. A Tableau Public link will showcase the final interactive dashboard, when available.
